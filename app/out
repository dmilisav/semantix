In time, the mentored person, or prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9, takes on the role of mentor to some less experienced person. Mentoring in some form is a part of almost all cultures.

The doctor may advise the man who is scheduled for semen analysis to abstain from sex for two to four days beforehand. The semen analysis should include basic parameters such as sperm number, motility, and morphology (shape). In a normal ejaculation the total volume of semen is between a half and a whole teaspoon. As part of the semen analysis, the technician will determine the number of sperm present in the ejaculate. A normal sperm concentration falls between 20 million/mL and 200 million/mL. The technician looks at how well the sperm are moving and counts the total percentage of motile sperm by figuring how many sperm per 100 are moving. At least 50% of any given sperm population should be moving. Then the sperm movement is qualified. A well developed sperm can propel itself up a woman's reproductive tract at a rate of more than 2 inches an hour. Finally, the shape or morphology of the sperm is determined. Sperm heads should be oval-shaped without irregularities. In the event that the semen analysis is abnormal, it should be repeated, and referral to a urologist who specializes in male infertility should be considered. The evaluation of the male involves a thorough physical examination and hormonal testing. In the event that no sperm at all are found on a\xc2\xa0semen analysis, a testicular biopsy may be indicated.

His enigmatic views, based on the verdant northern woods of the Precambrian Shield, have few parallels in contemporary art.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0After finishing a degree at the Layton School of Art in Milwaukee, Uttech went to graduate school at the University of Cincinnati. He taught for a year at the Arkansas Art Center in Little Rock, and then a teaching position at the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee allowed him to return home. He was a professor of art at the University from 1968 until his resignation in 1998.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Since the 1960\xe2\x80\x99s Uttech has made numerous camping and canoeing trips in the Quetico Provincial Park in Ontario, Canada, and northern Minnesota. One aspect that distinguishes Uttech\xe2\x80\x99s paintings from most contemporary landscapes is that he does no drawings, studies, or photographs on these treks. They are studio inventions based entirely on memory and improvisation.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Over the years Uttech became increasingly dismayed with the inappropriate frames put on his canvases. Remembering the beautiful hand-painted molding of Gallen-Kallela\xe2\x80\x99s Waterfall at Mantykoski, which he had seen in the Northern Light exhibition organized by the Brooklyn Museum of Art in 1982, as well as colorful Scandinavian chests and furniture and his affection for the Pennsylvania Dutch art of Rosemaling, Uttech began making and painting his frames. These wide, flat pine moldings are finished with stains that range from clear to dark earth tones and are decorated with an assortment of wildlife, foliage, pictographs, and mythological creatures.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0As Tom Uttech has stated, \xe2\x80\x9cThe best response to my paintings would be for you to march right out of the gallery and go straight to the wildest piece of land you can find and sit down and let it wash over you and tell you secrets.\xe2\x80\x9dTaken from a text by John Arthur.

This depletion process leaves the object with a pure silver surface which is more resistant to tarnishing. The stain develops in sterling and coin silver when oxygen penetrates the outer surface of the object during brazing, oxidizing the copper content. Fine silver is left on the surface when acid chemically removes the oxidized copper, though, copper may be oxidized below the surface.

He may use an instrument to feel for cracks in the tooth and will inspect the gums around the tooth for irregularities. Dr. Boyd may also use a special instrument to test the tooth for fractures. One instrument looks like a toothbrush without bristles that fits over one part of the tooth at a time as you bite down. If you feel pain, the cusp being tested most likely has a crack affecting it. Your dentist may shine a fiber-optic light on the tooth or stain it with a special dye to search for a crack. If the tooth already has a filling or crown, your dentist may remove it so he or she can better inspect the tooth.', "Treatments for cracked tooth syndrome do not always completely relieve the symptoms. Treatment depends on the location, direction and extent of the crack. Cracks vary from superficial ones in the outer layers of the tooth to deep splits in the root affecting the pulp (the center of the tooth, which contains the tooth's nerves). If the crack affects one or more cusps of a tooth, the tooth may be restored with a crown or onlay. If a crack affects the pulp, you probably will need root canal treatment. About 20% of teeth with cracked tooth syndrome require root canals. After a root canal, the tooth will no longer be sensitive to temperature, but it still will respond to pressure. This means that if you felt pain when you bit down before the root canal, you probably will not feel it as intensely as before, but you may feel it from time to time. In some severe cases, the tooth may need to be extracted. Some cracks extend into the root of the tooth under the bone and there's no way to fix the tooth. If your dentist decides the tooth needs to be extracted, you can have it replaced with an implant or a bridge.", 'Patients with certain preexisting conditions may require "antibiotic prophylaxis."

", 'FSH Level Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is a biochemical marker of ovarian reserve. FSH is produced by the pituitary gland and helps control the menstrual cycle and the production of eggs by the ovaries. When FSH is tested as a fertility indicator, it is measured via blood test on the third day of the menstrual cycle, and is both a qualitative and quantitative measure of ovarian reserve. In general, the lower the FSH level, the better. An FSH level below 14 mIU/ml is considered normal in our laboratory. A high FSH level could indicate that the pituitary gland is working too hard. FSH is the primary hormone that drives the ovaries. When the body senses that there are fewer eggs than necessary to reproduce, the pituitary gland churns out higher levels of FSH to stimulate egg production. So higher FSH levels indicate reduced ovarian reserve, while lower FSH levels suggest a greater ovarian reserve and a higher chance of success with IVF.'])

', " is a procedure that is performed when a medical or psychological condition prevents a male from being able to ejaculate. Such conditions include spinal cord injury, retroperitoneal surgery that severs the sympathetic nerves to the perineum and psychological conditions. During rectal probe ejaculation, the male is positioned on his side and a doctor inserts an electrical stimulation probe into the rectum. The doctor controls the amount of electrical stimulation delivered so that an ejaculation occurs. This can be done either in the office or in the operating room with anesthesia depending on the sensory status of the patient. Alternative methods of sperm retrieval are recommended when penile vibratory stimulation and rectal probe ejaculation are unsuccessful or unavailable. Sperm are made in the testicle and travel through the epididymis and vas deferens before reaching the outside of the body. Sperm can be obtained directly from the man's reproductive tract using minor surgery. The most common method is obtaining sperm from the testicle. This may be done in an open procedure. Alternatively, a closed procedure may be done in which no incision is made and a needle is passed through the scrotal skin directly into the testicle. The number of sperm obtained from any of these procedures is small and thus an advanced ART technique such as  is required. ", "The initial male fertility evaluation consists of a thorough history and physical examination. The couple's marital history is important, particularly with regard to prior marriages and sex partners. All miscarriages, elective terminations, and pregnancies initiated by the patient or partner should be elicited. Childhood and developmental conditions that may have an impact on fertility include a history of undescended testicles, testicular torsion, trauma, and precocious or delayed puberty. Systemic illnesses such as diabetes mellitus, multiple sclerosis, and spinal-cord injury may impair normal ejaculation. Any previous retroperitoneal, pelvic, inguinal, or scrotal surgery should be noted. Prior exposure to sexually transmitted diseases may lead to reproductive-tract scarring. Because intratesticular sperm maturation requires 74 days, exposure during the past several months to systemic illness, fevers, excessive heat, or various medications should be elicited. Prior exposure to gonadotoxins such as chemotherapy, radiation, exogenous androgenic steroids, as well as excessive alcohol use, cigarette smoking, and use of marijuana and other recreational drugs have all been associated with decreased fertility. Finally, it is important to inquire about the couple's sexual history including the frequency and timing of intercourse. To achieve conception, sexual intercourse should be initiated prior to ovulation and continued at a frequency of every other day during the ovulatory period.

A Reproductive Endocrinologist, also known as a fertility specialist, will typically perform a workup to evaluate a patient's overall health as well as measure her ovarian reserve- the quantity and quality of the eggs in her ovaries.

The results of these tests help the fertility specialist gauge a patient's potential success using IVF or other assisted reproductive technologies (ART).", 'A young boy makes a wish at a fairground machine to be big.

', 'The 2011 season of Pumpkin Ale has proven to be one the most successful seasonal sellers for craft beer makers. The popularity of falls favorite \xe2\x80\x9cPumpkin Beer\xe2\x80\x9d has become all the rage. \xc2\xa0With more than 400 pumpkin beers to choose from today, modern drinkers may not be tasting anything like their beer\xe2\x80\x99s colonial ancestors.Many would be surprised to discover that Pumpkin Beer has a history in America; its tale goes all the way back to the 1600\xe2\x80\x99s with \xe2\x80\x9cAmerica\xe2\x80\x99s first folk song\xe2\x80\x9d While most Europeans had never even seen a pumpkin, both pumpkins and brown sugar were easily accessible in early uncolonized America, while proper malt was not.
